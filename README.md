Tiling simulation (lozenge, aztec, fortress). Based on Matlab simulation for lozenge tiling of hexagon by Christophe Charlier, Lund University, ported to javascript/pixi.js with various optimisations & added functionality. Algorithm for generating tiling is based on Generalized domino-shuffling, James Propp ([arXiv:math/0111034](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0111034)).
